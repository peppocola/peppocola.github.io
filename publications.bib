  abstract = {Issue labeling is a crucial task for the effective management of software projects. To date, several approaches have been put forth for the automatic assignment of labels to issue reports. In particular, supervised approaches based on the fine-tuning of BERT-like language models have been proposed, achieving state-of-the-art performance. More recently, decoder-only models such as GPT have become prominent in SE research due to their surprising capabilities to achieve state-of-the-art performance even for tasks they have not been trained for. To the best of our knowledge, GPT-like models have not been applied yet to the problem of issue classification, despite the promising results achieved for many other software engineering tasks. In this paper, we investigate to what extent we can leverage GPT-like LLMs to automate the issue labeling task. Our results demonstrate the ability of GPT-like models to correctly classify issue reports in the absence of labeled data that would be required to fine-tune BERT-like LLMs.CCS CONCEPTS{$\bullet$} Software and its engineering {$\rightarrow$} Documentation; Software evolution; Maintaining software; {$\bullet$} Information systems {$\rightarrow$} Clustering and classification;},

In this tool competition edition, six teams submitted multiple classification models to automatically classify issue reports and code comments. The submitted models were fine-tuned and evaluated on a benchmark dataset of 3 thousand issue reports or 82 thousand code comments, respectively. This paper reports details of the competition, including the rules, the teams and contestant models, and the ranking of models based on their average classification performance across issue report and code comment types.},

	abstract     = {Context: Issue labeling is a fundamental task for software development as it is critical for the effective management of software projects. This practice involves assigning a label to issues, such as bug or feature request, denoting a task relevant to the project management. To date, large language models (LLMs) have been proposed to automate this task, including both fine-tuned BERT-like models and zero-shot GPT-like models. Objectives: In this paper, we investigate which LLMs offer the best trade-off between performance, response time, hardware requirements, and quality of the responses for issue report classification. Methods: We design and execute a comprehensive benchmark study to assess 22 generative decoder-only LLMs and 2 baseline BERT-like encoder-only models, which we evaluate on two different datasets of GitHub issues. Results: Generative LLMs demonstrate potential for zero-shot classification. However, their performance varies significantly across datasets and they require substantial computational resources for deployment. In contrast, BERT-like models show more consistent performance and lower resource requirements. Conclusions: Based on the empirical evidence provided in this study, we discuss implications for researchers and practitioners. In particular, our results suggest that fine-tuning BERT-like encoder-only models enables achieving consistent, state-of-the-art performance across datasets even in presence of a small amount of labeled data available for training.}
