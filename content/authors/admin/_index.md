      **Mark**: 110/110 cum laude

      **Thesis**: "Issue report classification using BERT"
      
      **Abstract**: "This thesis explores the automatic classification of issue reports in software development, aiming to improve efficiency in issue management and prioritization. It addresses the challenge of misclassification between bug reports, enhancement requests, and questions, which consumes valuable developer resources. Leveraging recent advances in natural language processing, specifically BERT and its variants, the study develops and evaluates supervised learning approaches using issue text and authorship information. The proposed models surpass baseline performance, achieving an F1 score of .8591 using textual data alone. The research includes a comprehensive error analysis to identify key factors influencing classification accuracy. The findings underscore the practical utility of automated issue labeling systems in optimizing software development processes."

## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I am Giuseppe Colavito, a PhD student of the Italian [National PhD in Artificial Intelligence for Society](https://phd-ai-society.di.unipi.it/), supervised by Dr. [Nicole Novielli](https://collab.di.uniba.it/nicole/) and Dr. [Filippo Lanubile](http://www.di.uniba.it/~lanubile/).   
I hold dual affiliations with the University of Pisa and the University of Bari.  
Previously, I was a Visiting Student Researcher at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, for the Safety and Mission Assurance Department. 
My research interests revolve around Natural Language Processing (NLP), Software Engineering, and Machine Learning.
