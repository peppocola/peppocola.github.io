        My research focuses on **generative AI** for automatic labeling in software engineering, with a case study on **issue report classification**.
        
        I aim to improve the accuracy and efficiency of issue classification by leveraging few-shot learning and large language models (LLMs).
        
        The **goal** is to develop methods that require minimal labeled data and reduce the manual effort needed for annotation, ensuring effective application in both open-source and industrial settings.
        
        I am currently collaborating with **NASA Goddard Space Flight Center** to test the effectiveness of current approaches for issue classification in the industry.
