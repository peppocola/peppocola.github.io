During the [NLBSE 2023 tool competition](https://nlbse2023.github.io/), I presented my paper [Few-shot Learning for Issue Report Classification](10.1109/NLBSE59153.2023.00011). After my talk, I was invited to be the co-chair of the NLBSE tool competition in 2024. I am excited to take on this role and help organize the competition next year. Stay tuned for more updates on the competition and how you can participate!
