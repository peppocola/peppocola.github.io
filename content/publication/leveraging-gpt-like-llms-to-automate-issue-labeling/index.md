abstract: Issue labeling is a crucial task for the effective management of
  software projects. To date, several approaches have been put forth
  for the automatic assignment of labels to issue reports. In particu-
  lar, supervised approaches based on the fine-tuning of BERT-like
  language models have been proposed, achieving state-of-the-art
  performance. More recently, decoder-only models such as GPT have
  become prominent in SE research due to their surprising capabili-
  ties to achieve state-of-the-art performance even for tasks they have
  not been trained for. To the best of our knowledge, GPT-like models
  have not been applied yet to the problem of issue classification,
  despite the promising results achieved for many other software
  engineering tasks. In this paper, we investigate to what extent we
  can leverage GPT-like LLMs to automate the issue labeling task.
  Our results demonstrate the ability of GPT-like models to correctly
  classify issue reports in the absence of labeled data that would be
  required to fine-tune BERT-like LLMs.
