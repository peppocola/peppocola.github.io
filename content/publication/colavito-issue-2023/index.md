abstract: This paper describes our participation in the tool competition organized
  in the scope of the 1st International Workshop on Natural Language-based Software
  Engineering. We propose a supervised approach relying on fine-tuned BERT-based language
  models for the automatic classification of GitHub issues. We experimented with different
  pre-trained models, achieving the best performance with fine-tuned RoBERTa (F1 =
  .8591).
