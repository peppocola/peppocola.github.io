abstract: "We describe our participation in the tool competition in the scope of
  the 2nd International Workshop on Natural Language-based Software Engineering.
  We propose a supervised approach relying on SETFIT, a framework for few-shot
  learning and sentence-BERT (SBERT), a variant of BERT for effective sentence
  embedding. We experimented with different settings, achieving the best
  performance by training and testing the SETFIT-based model on a subset of data
  with manually verified labels (Fl-micro =.8321 ). For the sake of the
  challenge, we evaluate the SETFIT model on the challenge test set, achieving
  Fl-micro =.7767 "
