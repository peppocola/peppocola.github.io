abstract: This paper describes the participation of a team from the University of
  Bari in the Decluttering Challenge organized in the scope of the DocGen2 workshop.
  We propose a supervised approach relying on a minimal set of non-textual features
  (length, overlapping between the comment text and the source code, code block type,
  tags, comment type) and classical textual features (bag-of-words). Our system ranked
  2nd in the documentation decluttering task.
