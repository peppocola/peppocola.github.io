abstract: Issue labeling is a crucial task for the effective management of software
  projects. To date, several approaches have been put forth for the automatic assignment
  of labels to issue reports. In particular, supervised approaches based on the fine-tuning
  of BERT-like language models have been proposed, achieving state-of-the-art performance.
  More recently, decoder-only models such as GPT have become prominent in SE research
  due to their surprising capabilities to achieve state-of-the-art performance even
  for tasks they have not been trained for. To the best of our knowledge, GPT-like
  models have not been applied yet to the problem of issue classification, despite
  the promising results achieved for many other software engineering tasks. In this
  paper, we investigate to what extent we can leverage GPT-like LLMs to automate the
  issue labeling task. Our results demonstrate the ability of GPT-like models to correctly
  classify issue reports in the absence of labeled data that would be required to
  fine-tune BERT-like LLMs.CCS CONCEPTS• Software and its engineering → Documentation;
