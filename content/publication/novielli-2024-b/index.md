abstract: QualAI is a two-year project aimed at defining a set of recommenders to
  continuously monitor, assess, and improve the quality of AI-based systems, with
  a particular focus on machine learning (ML) applications. We will develop recommenders
  for the quality assurance of both data and ML models to enable practitioners to
  mitigate technical debt. Special attention will be paid to communication challenges
  that may arise in hybrid teams comprising data scientists and software developers.
  This paper presents the project outline, provides an executive summary of the research
  activities, outlines the expected project outcomes, and reports the results obtained
  to date.
