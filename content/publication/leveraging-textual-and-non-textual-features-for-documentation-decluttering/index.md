abstract: This paper describes the participation of a team from the University
  of Bari in the Decluttering Challenge organized in the scope of the DocGen2
  workshop. We propose a supervised approach relying on a minimal set of
  non-textual features (length, overlapping between the comment text and the
  source code, code block type, tags, comment type) and classical textual
  features (bag-of-words). Our system ranked 2nd in the documentation
  decluttering task.
