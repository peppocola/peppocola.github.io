abstract: We describe our participation in the tool competition in the scope of the
  2nd International Workshop on Natural Language-based Software Engineering. We propose
  a supervised approach relying on SETFIT, a framework for few-shot learning and sentence-BERT
  (SBERT), a variant of BERT for effective sentence embedding. We experimented with
  different settings, achieving the best performance by training and testing the SETFIT-based
  model on a subset of data with manually verified labels (Fl-micro =.8321). For the
  sake of the challenge, we evaluate the SETFIT model on the challenge test set, achieving
  Fl-micro =.7767.
