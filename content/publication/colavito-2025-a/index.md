abstract: 'Context: Issue labeling is a fundamental task for software development
  as it is critical for the effective management of software projects. This practice
  involves assigning a label to issues, such as bug or feature request, denoting a
  task relevant to the project management. To date, large language models (LLMs) have
  been proposed to automate this task, including both fine-tuned BERT-like models
  and zero-shot GPT-like models. Objectives: In this paper, we investigate which LLMs
  offer the best trade-off between performance, response time, hardware requirements,
  and quality of the responses for issue report classification. Methods: We design
  and execute a comprehensive benchmark study to assess 22 generative decoder-only
  LLMs and 2 baseline BERT-like encoder-only models, which we evaluate on two different
  datasets of GitHub issues. Results: Generative LLMs demonstrate potential for zero-shot
  classification. However, their performance varies significantly across datasets
  and they require substantial computational resources for deployment. In contrast,
  BERT-like models show more consistent performance and lower resource requirements.
  Conclusions: Based on the empirical evidence provided in this study, we discuss
  implications for researchers and practitioners. In particular, our results suggest
  that fine-tuning BERT-like encoder-only models enables achieving consistent, state-of-the-art
  performance across datasets even in presence of a small amount of labeled data available
  for training.'
