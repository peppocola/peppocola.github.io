 abstract = {This paper describes our participation in the tool competition organized in the scope of the 1st International Workshop on Natural Language-based Software Engineering. We propose a supervised approach relying on fine-tuned BERT-based language models for the automatic classification of GitHub issues. We experimented with different pre-trained models, achieving the best performance with fine-tuned RoBERTa (F1 = .8591).},
